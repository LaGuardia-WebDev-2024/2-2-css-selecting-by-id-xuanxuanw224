## Directions 
### Step 1 - Color the winter heading <br>
This webpage describes the favorite seasons of Olaf, a sun-loving snowman. Both of the `<h2>` tags have id's, but there are no CSS rules for styling them yet. 
<br><br>
Add two CSS rules so that the color of each `<h2>` tag is different.  
<br>
That means you will have to use the ID as the CSS Selector in your `<style>` tags.
